# 8086 Emulator
This repo contains some self taught assembly work using the 8086 emulator. Currently, I have two programs: Calculator and Mouse Tracker.

## Calculator

This program can do 16-bit addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents. It is a bare bones program, but it was the first program I made to get me warmed up to x86 assembly.

## Mouse Tracker

This is a cursor tracker program that is self explanitory. Once you run the program, you can move your cursor all across the terminal and in the top-left corner, it displays the pixel coordinates of your cursor. To exit, hold down the right mouse button.
